- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
	- Train Name
	- Destination
	- First Train Time -- in military time
	- Frequency -- in minutes

	
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
